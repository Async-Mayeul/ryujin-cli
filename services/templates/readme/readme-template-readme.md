# How to use docker compose
## What is docker compose ?
Docker compose is used to define and run multi-container application. Compose can control your entier stack.
You can manage services, networks, volumes with a single YAML file.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

## Run docker compose
- In your project directory, start your application.
```sh
docker compose up
```
- Down your application
```sh
docker compose down
```
- List local images
```sh
docker image ls
```
- Inspect an image
```sh
docker inspect <id>
```
