Nginx is a high-performance, scalable web server that efficiently handles multiple protocols and tasks. Renowned for its ability to manage a large number of concurrent connections with low memory usage, Nginx is ideal for serving static content, acting as a reverse proxy, and load balancing HTTP and TCP traffic. When combined with Docker, Nginx offers a flexible and portable solution for deploying and managing web applications, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
